        <h2>A little more about me</h2>
        <p>My passion is adventure travel and story telling. I have driven from Alaska to Argentina, Have crossed the Sahara desert in a 4x4 and have explored every corner on 5 continents from the jungles of Borneo to the peaks of the Andes</p>
        <p>I am finally ready to slow down a little bit, stay in once place for a while and work on myself and my career.</p>

        <h2>A little more...</h2>
        <p>The unknown is something that you can only ever fear or embrace. The open road. The journey. Unrelenting tarmac, yourself, your few meager possessions and your ride. Nothing is more evocative of the freedom and myth of the American Dream. </p>
        
        <p>The romanticism of this dream, of this freedom, is in the utter and complete resignation to this unknown. It is in giving yourself over to the will; the beat of the road, allowing yourself to be shaped and molded by it. It is in taking the setbacks, accepting the hard times and being elated by the dizzying highs. It is not just geographical liberty that it provides, but by forcing you to abandon control it gives you a freedom to embrace a future of unknowable possibility. </p>
